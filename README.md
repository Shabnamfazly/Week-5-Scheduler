# Week-5-Scheduler

## Description
This challenge was to create a workday scheduler using jquery and APIs that saves data to the local storage for the purpose of allowing the user manage their time effectively. This involved dynamically updating HTML and starting javascript from scratch. Using Javascript, JQuery and the skills from class, I used arrays, If functions and loops, and the day.js APIs to create a daily workday scheduler.The interactive scheduler allows a user to update their daily planner. When a user views the page they are presented with todays date and time followed by a 9-5 sceduler. Depending on the time , the divided blocks will be color coded to indicate if it is in the past, present or future. A user can then select any time block and update the events sceduled for that specific time this is then saved to local storage.


## Usage
The application is simple to use it allows the user to save events for each hour of the working day. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is the past, present, or future. When the save button for each timeblock is clicked, the text input for that event is saved in local storage. This will allow the user to manage their time more effectively.

Below I've attached a screenshot of the deployed application as well as the link to the deployed link of the application:
